In places, there is still magic in this world. There are points in time and space that are filled with living, breathing, beating, pulsing, flaring magic. With the primal essence of life and reality: that which separates *being* from *not.* Far from lights and noise, they are places where stars still shine in the night sky, where quiet feet can be heard in the darkness, and where peering eyes glimmer from the shadows between the trees. In such places, all that man has learned means less, because they are filled with what he has forgotten.

<!-- Hal: I think you need a transition paragraph here, along with some knoodling on whether "magic" is real or temporal. (Not sure what he means by "temporal.") -->

For Grier O'Connell, each new dawn was a place filled with magic. To squander it, to let that moment between moments pass by unmarked, without a promise to herself to make the most of the day, was the gravest sin she could imagine. That's why sunrise found her in the same place each day: gasping for breath at the end of her morning run as she watched the red sun take flight over downtown. This morning, in spite of the muggy heat and the hot, summer rain, was no exception. Grier stretched, breathed, and mopped her brow with the sleeve of her hoodie.

<!-- Hal: An extension of prior comment: would like to see you link the run and the exhaustion to the magic place. (Good idea: physical duress is linked with the sight.) -->

Today would be a beautiful day. She'd make sure of it.

Her run finished on the top floor of a parking garage, across the street from the convention center and down the block from a little donut shop where she bought breakfast each morning. She chose that spot because it made the final push that much more painful: she had to fight for every inch, to force herself up the long, steep ramps of the garage. At that point, it wasn't about strength or conditioning; it was about sheer determination. Things are always hardest just before they're over---except in the case of going back down the stairs after finishing her run. That could be hard even after everything was over.

Back on the street, *DONUT* blared in hot, red neon both in the window and reflected off the wet sidewalk. Just *DONUT*---singular, not plural. Grier slipped through the door into the wet, air-conditioned cool of the shop, and she began her morning ritual with the owner.
